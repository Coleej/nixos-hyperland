  # wsl is excluded: WSL2 has no real GPU passthrough (node-llama-cpp falls
  # back to slow CPU inference there), so that Claude Code instance instead
  # points at a GPU-accelerated qmd server running natively on the Windows
  # host it runs under (~3x faster on the same RX 6700 XT via native Vulkan,
  # vs. WSL's fake/absent DRM device). See project notes for that setup.
